abstract: Excavators are widely used for material-handling applications in unstructured environments, including mining and construction. The size of the global market of excavators is 44.12 Billion USD in 2018 and is predicted to grow to 63.14 Billion USD by 2026. Operating excavators in a real-world environment can be challenging due to extreme conditions and rock sliding, ground collapse, or exceeding dust. Multiple fatalities and injuries occur each year during excavations. An autonomous excavator that can substitute human operators in these hazardous environments would substantially lower the number of injuries and can improve the overall productivity.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper emphasizes the potential of autonomous excavators to enhance safety and productivity by replacing human operators in hazardous conditions within a multi-billion-dollar global market.
