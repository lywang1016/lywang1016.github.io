abstract: Autonomous landing of a quadrotor UAV on a vessel deck is challenging due to the special sea environment. In this paper, we present an on-board monocular vision based solution that provides a quadrotor with the capability to autonomously track and land on a vessel deck platform with simulated high sea state conditions. The whole landing process includes two stages, approaching from a long range and landing after hovering above the landing platform. Only on-board sensors are used in both stages, without external information input. We use Parrot AR.Drone as the experimental quadrotor platform, and a self-designed vessel deck emulator is constructed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed vessel deck landing solution. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the developed landing algorithms.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presents a monocular vision-based solution for autonomous quadrotor UAV landing on a vessel deck under challenging sea conditions, using on-board sensors only. Experimental results with a Parrot AR.Drone platform confirm the solution's accuracy and robustness.
