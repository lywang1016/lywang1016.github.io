abstract: According  to  the  characteristics  of  land  vehicle  navigation,  a  new  DR  navigation algorithm was proposed based on speed pulse. The new DR navigation algorithm does not limited to the local east-north flat plane, and can provide real-time latitude and longitude according to the earth  model, based on velocity  vector  calculated  under the east-north-up  coordinate.  Then a  new data  fusion  method  for  GPS/DR  integrated  navigation  system  was  developed  in detail.  This method  has  good  robustness  and  is  easier  to  apply  to  industry.  Simulation  and  field  running experiments show that this method can satisfy the basic requirement of land vehicle navigation. It improves the degree of precision and is able to work even when GPS signals are masked. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A new Dead Reckoning (DR) navigation algorithm based on speed pulse for land vehicles provides real-time latitude and longitude calculations, while a robust GPS/DR integrated navigation data fusion method improves precision and works effectively even in GPS signal-interfered environments.
