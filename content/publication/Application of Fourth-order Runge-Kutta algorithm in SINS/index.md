abstract: In order to optimize accuracy and complexity of SINS algorithm, this work applied Fourth-order  Runge-Kutta  algorithm  on attitude  and  velocity  calculation.  It  is  shown  that  this method leads to  a better  performance.  First  of  all, high  accuracy  digital integration  algorithm for calculating  attitude, velocity  and  position  was  carried  out  according to the  previous findings  was introduced.  After  that,  new  algorithms  of  attitude  and  velocity  calculation  using  the  theory  of  Runge-Kutta  algorithm  were  deduced  in  detail.  By  adopting  the  data  of  trajectory  generator,  the error  feature  curves  of  navigation  results  from  the  two  algorithms  (that  is  the  previous  digital integration  algorithm  and  the  new  algorithm  based  on  Runge -Kutta  algorithm)  were  obtained, respectively. Comparison with the two algorithms clearly shows that the performance of Fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm  is better  than  that of high accuracy digital  integration algorithm.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This research introduces a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm to enhance the accuracy and performance of Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS) calculations compared to traditional high-accuracy digital integration methods.
