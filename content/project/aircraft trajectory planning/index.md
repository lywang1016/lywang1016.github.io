title: Aircraft Trajectory Planning with Multi-Objectives
summary: This project aims to research and develop a four-dimensional trajectory planning method for aircraft. The trajectory's constraint conditions include avoidance of no-fly zones and terrain obstacles, collision avoidance with surrounding moving aircraft, trajectory smoothness, and constraints on aircraft speed and acceleration. The optimization goals for the trajectory include minimizing the trajectory duration and maximizing comfort.
