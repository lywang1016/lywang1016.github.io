This is a big project. My research and works on this has three directions, excavator arm motion planning, trajectory optimization, and control, crawler excavator base motion planning and control, and task-level planning involving decision-making. 

To better support this project, besides my research and implementation, I have also developed a soil kinematic simulation based on ROS, and built a excavator robot system by modifying a mini-excavator, add sensors and make computer directly gives control commands, instead of using a joystick.
