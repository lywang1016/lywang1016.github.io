title: Wheeled Robot Movement Modeling and Control
summary: This project focuses on the modeling and control of wheeled robots, including three sub-projects I have completed at different times. They are autonomous taxiing of aircraft on the runway, crawler chassis locomotion for excavators, and a robotic guide dog for vision impaired people.
